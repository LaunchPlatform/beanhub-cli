Command line tools for BeanHub or Beancount users.

Please read the [documentation here](https://beanhub-cli-docs.beanhub.io).

## Features

- **Local BeanHub Form web app** - You can run a [BeanHub Form](https://beanhub.io/blog/2023/07/31/automating-beancount-data-input-with-beanhub-custom-forms/) web app locally to try out your forms
- **Import** - Simple yet powerful [beanhub-import](https://github.com/LaunchPlatform/beanhub-import) allows you to define importing rules in YAML to extract transactions from CSV files and generate Beancount transactions automatically
- **Formatter** - Advanced Beancount file formatter based on top of [beancount-black](https://github.com/LaunchPlatform/beancount-black)
- **Basic Beancount file manipulations** - Effortless Beancount account name renaming and other basic manipulations (coming soon)
- **Doesn't require a BeanHub account** - While some features in the future will require a BeanHub repository to operate, but we make most of them usable even without a BeanHub account
