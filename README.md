# beanhub-cli [![CircleCI](https://dl.circleci.com/status-badge/img/gh/LaunchPlatform/beanhub-cli/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://dl.circleci.com/status-badge/redirect/gh/LaunchPlatform/beanhub-cli/tree/master)
Command line tools for BeanHub.

## Features

- **Local BeanHub Form web app** - You can run a [BeanHub Form](https://beanhub.io/blog/2023/07/31/automating-beancount-data-input-with-beanhub-custom-forms/) web app locally to try out your forms
- **Formatter** - Advanced Beancount file formatter based on top of [beancount-black](https://github.com/LaunchPlatform/beancount-black)
- **Basic Beancount file manipulations** - Effortless Beancount account name renaming and other basic manipulations (coming soon)
- **Doesn't require a BeanHub account** - While some features in the future will require a BeanHub repository to operate, but we make most of them usable even without a BeanHub account
